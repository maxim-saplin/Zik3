# Welcome to Zik3!
Zik3 adding Bluetooth support on Mac OS 10.13 for the headphones Parrot Zik 3.

The origin of the code is the following project: http://picaso.github.io/parrot-zik-status/
which stopped working with MacOS 10.13.
I mostly used the patch proposed here: https://github.com/picaso/parrot-zik-status/issues/14#issuecomment-347964583

### AEXM
The [AEXM library](https://github.com/tadija/AEXML) made by [tadija](https://github.com/tadija) is needed for this project. It is added in the AEXM folder.

## Build
To build the app you need Xcode, which can be downloaded for free from the Mac AppStore. Once this is installed the remaining step is building the program, by clicking on __Product > Archive > Distribute App > Copy App__

The app will be in the folder you filled in.
Drag and drop it in your application folder __/Applications__.
